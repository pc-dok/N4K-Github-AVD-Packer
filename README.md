## N4K-Github-AVD-Packer
Create Azure AVD with a AADDS and Packer Images

On Azure create first a new Contributor Role
az ad sp create contributer command - and dont forget
to give this CLI all the needed Roles

--< az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/yourID" >--

Subscriptions - IAM - there you see all roles, and you can create a assignment
Roles and Assignments for the azure-cli service principal:

Contributor \
Application Administrator Role \
Domain Service Contributor \
User Access Administrator \
Cloud Application Administrator \
Network Contributor \
User Administrator

```sh
- Because of higher security we want not save the tfstate files in our repo, so i take terraform workspaces
- You must create in your terraform cloud first for every step 4 different workspaces (up2you)
- every workspace must have the Azure credentials from your created rbac account stored
- also you need in your github - settings - a personal access token generated - this is the github secret
-- GITHUB_OWNER	
-- GITHUB_SECRET
-- ARM_TENANT_ID
-- ARM_SUBSCRIPTION
-- ARM_CLIENT_ID	
-- ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
```


## 1. Create Packer Environment
First - Create Images for the Jumpinghost and the AVD - Server 2022 and Windows 11

```sh
- We will create a Github Repo, add there the Secrets what is needed for Azure
- Than we parsing our files what we are needing to create packer images
- Last step is creating the workflow files
- Now you will see unter Actions - a Packer 11 and a Packer 2022 Workflow - Let it run!
```

- Create a Github Repo
- Create the needed files
- ✨Magic: Github Workflow fully created - let it run ✨


> On the end you should have 2 Images in your Azure Ressource Group. 
> That Images we take later for our Jumping Host, and for the Windows 11 AVD!

## 2. Create the Azure Active Domain Directory Service
We create a AADDS - because i have no onprem AD. And for joining Computers you need an AD :)

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh


## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development


First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker


```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
